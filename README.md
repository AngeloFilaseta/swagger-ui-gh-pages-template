# Swagger UI GitHub Pages Template 
This repository provides a template for setting up Swagger UI on GitHub Pages.
Swagger UI is a powerful tool for documenting and testing APIs, and with this template,
you can easily deploy it on GitHub Pages to share your API documentation with others.

## How to Use

## Accessing Swagger UI

Once you have deployed your Swagger UI documentation to GitHub Pages, you can access it by visiting the following URL:

```
https://your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name/
```

Replace `your-github-username` with your actual GitHub username and `your-repository-name` with the name of your repository.

## Resources

- [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/): Swagger UI is a collection of HTML, JavaScript,
and CSS assets that dynamically render Swagger-compliant documentation from an OpenAPI Specification.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/): GitHub Pages allows you to host static websites directly
from your GitHub repository, making it a convenient choice for hosting Swagger UI documentation.
